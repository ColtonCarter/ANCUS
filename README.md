# Project ANCUS (Aurora University Computer Science Notebook)
Capstone Project, developed by Jared Murray, and Colton Carter. Fall 2016. 

This project composed of a Raspberry Pi, a touchscreen, and a custom 3d printed case. 
The goal of this project was to create an application that would be used to market information 
about the Aurora University Computer Science Department to anyone interested.

This device is intended to be use at the Aurora University "Trade Shows" and is intended
to provide information to those with little to no knowledge of the Computer Science department at 
Aurora University.

This device was created over a 12 week time span and uses Python, Tkinter, a touchscreen, a 3d printed 
rubber band launcher, controller to aim said device, and bash shell scripts to provide the user with an 
interactive experience while promoting the University. 

The application has over 16 videos from various teachers and students of AU. Also the application provides 
information on the possible careers paths a computer science student may want to pursue at AU.

What is accessible in this project? 

We are providing the python source code of the application and bash shells that run the rubber band launcher 
and the buttons of our controller. 

We will be providing the Maker bot files for the 3d printed case, and the fritzing diagram for the wiring. 

What is not accessible in this project. 

No videos or images will be provided, in order to protect those that volunteered their time 
to make this project as successfully as it was.
